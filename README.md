# 3D Collision Detection Simulator

A web-based 3D collision detection demonstration using Three.js and custom AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) implementation.

## Overview

This project demonstrates real-time 3D collision detection between two cubes using AABB collision detection algorithm. One cube remains stationary while the other moves back and forth, with visual feedback when collisions occur.

## Features

- Real-time 3D visualization using Three.js
- Custom AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) implementation
- Visual collision feedback (color changes)
- Responsive design that adapts to window resizing
- Wireframe bounding box visualization

## Technical Implementation

The project includes:

- Custom `AABB` class for collision detection
- Three.js scene setup with camera and renderer
- Dynamic object movement and collision checking
- Wireframe helpers for visual debugging

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. You should see two cubes: one stationary (green) and one moving (red)
4. When the cubes collide, they both turn blue

## Dependencies

- Three.js (r128)
